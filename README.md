# Natural Langauge Processing

I had an assignment in which we were asked to:

Select an open-source language model of your choice (e.g., LLaMA 3, Mistral, Gemma, etc.) and fine-tune it using an instruction-based dataset. Your task is to:
1. Document your fine-tuning process — include model selection, dataset preparation, training configuration, and compute used.
2. Evaluate the model before and after fine-tuning using a set of testing prompts. Compare its performance with respect to f1, Rouge-L, and Bert-score
