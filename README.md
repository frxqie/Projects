# Machine Learning I: Supervised Learning

In this course we learned different types of supervised learning models:
Linear Regression, Logistic Regrission, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
We also learned data cleaning techniques: Feature Encoding and Feature Scaling.

At the end of the course, we worked on a big project and used all these models on a Housing Dataset.
The file included shows the implementation of everything I learned. I used all the different models to get the highest accuarcy.
